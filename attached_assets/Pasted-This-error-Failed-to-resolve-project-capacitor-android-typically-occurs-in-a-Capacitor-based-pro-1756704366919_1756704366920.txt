This error, Failed to resolve: project :capacitor-android, typically occurs in a Capacitor-based project when the Android Gradle build system cannot locate the capacitor-android library module within your project structure. This module is the core of the Capacitor runtime on Android and is essential for your app to function.The most common reason for this error is that the Capacitor project has not been properly synchronized with the native Android project.Primary Solution: Run Capacitor SyncThe definitive solution is usually to run the Capacitor command-line interface (CLI) sync command. This command copies your web assets, updates native dependencies, and crucially, sets up the capacitor-android project module correctly for Gradle to find.1.Open a terminal or command prompt in the root directory of your web project (the folder that contains your package.json file).2.Run the following command:Shell Scriptnpx cap sync android3.After the command completes successfully, return to Android Studio and sync your project again by clicking File > Sync Project with Gradle Files or the Sync Now button that appears in the editor notification bar.Troubleshooting Further IssuesIf running npx cap sync android does not resolve the problem, consider these other possibilities:1. Incorrect Directory Opened in Android StudioEnsure you have opened the correct directory in Android Studio. You should open the android sub-directory that Capacitor generates, not the root of your entire web project.•Correct: /path/to/your/project/android•Incorrect: /path/to/your/project/2. Outdated or Corrupt node_modulesSometimes, the issue can stem from your project's Node.js dependencies. You can try reinstalling them.1.In your terminal (at the project root), delete the node_modules folder and the package-lock.json file.2.Run npm install to reinstall all dependencies.3.Run npx cap sync android again.4.Re-sync the project in Android Studio.3. Manual Check of settings.gradleThe cap sync command should automatically configure your settings.gradle (or settings.gradle.kts) file to include the necessary Capacitor modules. If you suspect this process failed, you can check it manually.Open the settings.gradle or settings.gradle.kts file in the root of your Android project (/android/settings.gradle.kts). It should contain lines that include the Capacitor modules.For Kotlin DSL (settings.gradle.kts):Kotlin// ... other settings

project(':capacitor-cordova-android-plugins').projectDir = new File('../node_modules/@capacitor/cordova-android-plugins/src/main')Note: Manually editing these files is generally not recommended, as npx cap sync is designed to manage them for you. This step is primarily for verification.In most cases, running npx cap sync android from your project's root directory is the correct and sufficient solution.
